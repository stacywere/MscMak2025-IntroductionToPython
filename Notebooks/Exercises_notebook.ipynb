    "Write a function that reads a text file and counts the number of characters in it.  Print both the text file and the number of characters. Do this so that the printout isn't doubled space (use an end=\"\"  argument in the print statement). Also, skip a line before printing the count. Note that it is easy to get the number of characters in each line using the len() function. Here is my run for HumptyDumpty.txt.  Let me point out one thing that is not visible here and is a bit technical.  At the end of each of the first three lines there is a `newline` character.  These are invisible.  If you do the count by eye, you are likely to come up short by these three characters, but they are visible to len() and you should count them -- they are part of the 141 \"letters\" in the humptydumpty.txt file.  Counting them makes this an easier function for you to write.\n",
