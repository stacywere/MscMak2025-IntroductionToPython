    "# Quick Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks. These notes are provided for you to set it up the environment on your Computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebooks, which contain a complete and self-contained record of a computation. These notebooks can be shared more efficiently. The notebooks may contain:\n",
    "* Live code\n",
    "* Interactive widgets\n",
    "* Plots\n",
    "* Narrative text\n",
    "* Equations\n",
    "* Images\n",
    "* Video\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to note that \"Jupyter\" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R; the primary languages supported by Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook can allow a computational researcher to create reproducible documentation of their research. As Bioinformatics is datacentric, use of Jupyter Notebooks increases research transparency, hence promoting open science. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is made up of many cells. Each cell can contain Python code. You can execute a cell by clicking on it and pressing `Shift-Enter` or `Ctrl-Enter` (run without moving to the next line). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Further help\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Jupyter notebooks, check [the official introduction](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb) and [some useful Jupyter Tricks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, robust, high-level programming language. It is straightforward to pick up even if you are entirely new to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, similar to other languages like Matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However, writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has an extensive collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object-oriented and functional programming with a module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lectures are using Jupyter notebooks which mix Python code with documentation. The python notebooks can be run on a web server or stand-alone on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is broken up into a number of notebooks (lectures).\n",
